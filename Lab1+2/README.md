I was successfully able to download the Raspberry Pi Imager and loaded an SD card with Raspberry Pi OS

Then I setup my Pi's preferences and found its MAC address.

# Lab 1B: Raspberry Pi Configuration

I was able to change the hostname of my Pi and configure its display.

I was successfully able to add my credentials to the startup_mailer.py file.

Once added, I ran the file with python3 to receive the email, and it was delivered.

I was able to SSH into my Raspberry Pi from my Macbook.

After downloading VNC, I was also able to connect this way.
